This is the second of two schools where Kids on ComputersÂ® volunteers visited in October 2013. We established a computer lab using six purchased desktop computers. Like the computers at the other school, these computers were configured with Lubuntu 13.04, TuxSuite, GCompris, and additional educational software packages.

The volunteers conducted two training sessions at this school.
