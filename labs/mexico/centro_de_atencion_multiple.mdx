Centro de Atención Múltiple No. 27 (CAM 27) is a school for disabled children in the community of Tlaxiaco in the state of Oaxaca. A computer lab was established in 2009 with the help of early Kids on Computers® volunteers. The school was relocated and the not all computers turned on properly after the move. The current school building consists of one room, with the computer lab separated by a curtain from the general classroom.

In 2015 Kids on Computers® volunteers, some who live and work in the city of Oaxaca, visited the school to upgrade the computer lab and contributed six laptops to the installation.
