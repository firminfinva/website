Kids on Computers® volunteers first visited this school site in October 2012. The school was vacant, without teachers or students. We had carried some computers to establish a new lab there, but left that day without installing them.

In 2015, Kids on Computers® volunteers installed fifteen laptops at a newly built lab.
